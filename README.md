# Facebook Test User Manager

With the Graph API and OAuth 2.0 Facebook also introduced special test user accounts which could be created on the fly via the API for your specific application. This app is meant to manage those users making it easier to keep track of which ones you created and executing specific operations on them.

## Installation

Installation is very straight forward:

1. Download [source code](https://github.com/rdohms/facebook-testuser-manager/archives/master)
2. Place source code in your local web server document root
3. [OPTIONAL] Create a local virtualhost, like fum.local (the app can handle not being in root url)
4. [OPTIONAL] Copy config.ini.php.sample to a config.ini.php file and set App ID and Secret
5. Access the User Test Manager folder
6. [OPTIONAL] If the config file was not set, you can click on "Set/Unset Session Vars" to set App ID/Secret via session
