	<h1 id="about">About the App</h1>

	<p>This app was born out of a personal need to find a easier way to create new test users for facebook application testing. All related operations are only available through the API and facebook itself does not have a GUI interface were this can be executed, hence the need for this.</p>

	<p>Since I always defend you need to have pet projects you can work on and experience with new technologies, I decided to make this into an open source pet project and experiment with a few frameworks and tools I had not yet tried. The idea was to build a very simple site and that took the big frameworks off the table, I wanted to go for a simplistic structure with a very small MVC implementation and try some new view techniques.</p>

	<p>Thus I selected a few simple tools to work with:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Twig</strong> - A PHP implementation of the Django TEmplating engine with some inspiration in Jinja (<a href="https://github.com/fabpot/twig">by fabpot on github</a>)</li>
		<li><strong>Inspekt</strong> - A Input validation library, simple and straight forward (<a href="http://funkatron.github.com/inspekt/">by Funkatron on github</a>)</li>
		<li><strong>Zend Framework</strong> - I pulled in a few elements like the autoloader and registry, simple and reusable (<a href="http://framework.zend.com">By Zend</a>)</li>
	</ul>
